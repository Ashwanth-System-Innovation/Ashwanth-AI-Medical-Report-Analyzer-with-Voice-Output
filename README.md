NodeMCU is an open source [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) based firmware for the [ESP8266 WiFi SOC from Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) and uses an on-module flash-based [SPIFFS](https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs) file system. NodeMCU is implemented in C and is layered on the [Espressif NON-OS SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK).

🔬 AI-Driven Medical Imaging & Report Analysis System with Multilingual Voice Output
🧠 Project Description
This innovative project, built by Ashwanth, presents an AI-powered disease detection and medical report interpretation system designed to make healthcare more accessible and user-friendly. The system integrates advanced LLM (Large Language Model) APIs with image recognition technologies to analyze patient documents such as:

General medical reports

Blood test results

X-rays

MRI scans

CT scans

ECG charts

And more...

The core functionality is built around a modified document scanner connected to an Orange Pi via USB. When a patient places a report into the scanner and presses a button, the document is scanned and processed instantly. The data is forwarded to the AI engine, which performs real-time analysis and interprets the medical information.

To ensure maximum accessibility, the system includes a multilingual TTS (Text-to-Speech) engine using GCTTS, allowing users to receive the report summary in their preferred language — English, Tamil, or Malayalam — via audio output.

⚙️ Key Features
🔗 Orange Pi Integration for low-cost embedded processing

🖼️ Image Recognition & OCR to read and analyze scanned documents

🧠 LLM API Integration for natural language understanding and medical analysis

🔊 GCTTS-Based Voice Output in English, Tamil, and Malayalam

🏥 User-Friendly Design ideal for clinics, hospitals, or home use

🎯 Fast & Accurate disease detection and health report interpretation

🚀 Vision
This project aims to bridge the gap between patients and medical information by providing a tool that simplifies complex medical reports into understandable, spoken summaries in regional languages. It supports early disease detection, promotes health awareness, and ensures non-technical users get instant insights from their reports.
